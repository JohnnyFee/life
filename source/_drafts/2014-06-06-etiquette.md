## Punctuality['bæŋkwɪt, 宴会]

On Chinese Banquets, Timing is Everything. Guests should arrive on time. Punctuality[,pʌŋktjʊ'ælɪtɪ,严守时间] is a virtue['vɜːtjuː] in China. Banquets and business meetings are scheduled to start and finish on time, and the Western concept of “fashionably late” is not understood. If an event is scheduled to begin at 6:00 pm, for example, then arrive a few minutes early or at 6:00 pm sharp. To arrive later would be considered rude(无礼的). Just as they start on time, banquets also end on time. If a banquet is scheduled to end at 8:30 pm, the host should stand up and close the event at 8:30 pm sharp. It is considered rude to stay late or keep others at the banquet or meeting past the designated ending time.

## Banquets Structure

Chinese banquets typically last two hours. As guests arrive, they proceed through a receiving line in order of highest- to lowest-ranking hosts. Guests are then seated. Banquets in China have definitive[dɪ'fɪnɪtɪv, 限定的] beginnings and endings. The principal host offers a welcoming toast[干杯] to begin the banquet (or shortly thereafter), and it is customary[习惯的] for the principal guest to reciprocate[rɪ'sɪprəkeɪt, 互换]  with his/her own toast. Upon toasting, the formal meal begins. At the conclusion of the banquet, the host will again stand and toast, thanking the guests for attending. Again, it is customary for the principal guest to reciprocate in thanks to the hosts.

__Banquets Seating__

Seating is typically arranged ahead of time through staff-to-staff contacts, according to rank. The principal guest is seated to the right of the principal host at the head table. Other guests are seated at other tables in a manner mirroring seating at the head table. Guests should notify the Chinese host in advance of the rank of visiting members of the delegation. If hosting an event, be sure to seat people of high rank with others of high rank, doing otherwise may be considered offensive[ə'fensɪv, 无礼的].

## Banquets Toasting

Toasting is an indispensable[ɪndɪ'spensəb(ə)l, 不可缺少的] component of the Chinese banquet and it begins when the principal host offers a welcoming toast. Toasts are typically short (2 to 4 minutes) and may consist of a simple welcome, a brief statement filled with platitudes['plætɪtjuːd,  陈词滥调], or a substantive['sʌbst(ə)ntɪv, 有实质的] comment on the visit. Chinese rarely hold their glass at shoulder length when toasting, it is considered respectful to try and toast your glass lower than other’s glasses.

Alcohol ['ælkəhɒl, 乙醇] Cautions:

Several types of liquor['lɪkə, 酒]  are traditionally served at Chinese banquets (beer, wine, and baijiu (a potent['pəʊt(ə)nt, 烈性的]  liquor, of which the most famous brand is Maotai). Glasses are kept full during the meal to allow for toasting. Beer and wine[waɪn, 葡萄酒] may be sipped[sɪp, 抿] , but baijiu is traditionally downed at once like a western “shot” in toasts with the Chinese guests. The Chinese toast “gan bei” literally means “dry glass.” However, the tradition of emptying one’s glass at each toast is being tempered in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai where Western business etiquette has been more widely accepted. Increasingly, wine (frequently mixed with soda) is becoming the primary toasting drink in major cities. If you find yourself in a situation where baijiu is served, it is acceptable to drink less than the whole glass by saying “ban bei” (half a shot) or “sui yi” (as you wish).

It is also possible to beg out of drinking alcohol entirely by saying that you have an allergy['ælədʒɪ, 过敏症] or simply explaining that you do not drink. It also is acceptable to toast with a clear carbonated['kɑrbənetɪd, 碳酸的] drink like 7-Up or Sprite; just let the waiter know quietly that this is what you would like to do. If you are being hosted at a dinner (not a banquet) you often will be asked to choose what you would like to drink. Western drinks and social habits are becoming the norm in many ways, and are accepted in most urban['ɜːb(ə)n,  城市的] areas, however, it is advisable to handle such situations by stating your preferences as food and drink are ordered.

## Using Chopsticks ['tʃɒpstɪks] on Banquets

Chinese appreciate foreigners’ efforts to eat with chopsticks. If using chopsticks proves impossible and no forks are available, you can use the porcelain['pɔːs(ə)lɪn] spoon.

__Banquets Eating__

Formal banquets often include a dozen or more dishes. While declining[dɪ'klaɪn,下滑的] to taste a dish is not considered a cardinal['kɑːd(ɪ)n(ə)l, 主要的] offense[ə'fɛns, 过错], it is polite to try each dish that is served. This means it is important to pace yourself[自我调节]. Leaving a little on your plate[碟] signals your Chinese host that you are full. This is also a good strategy to avoid receiving another serving of a dish you do not like. An empty plate is a cue[提示] to your Chinese host that you are still hungry, and it will likely continue to be filled until you leave something on it. According to Chinese custom it is the role of the host to serve food to their guests, so do not be surprised if the host places food on your plate. If you are feeling very polite and have good chopstick control, you may reciprocate and attempt to serve the host, but it is not necessary. If you are hosting a dinner or banquet it is polite to make a gesture of serving guests on either side and then state clearly that everyone should please help himself/herself, adding “we are all friends and should be informal[ɪn'fɔːm(ə)l, 非正式的].”

## Last Name First

In China, the family name (surname) appears first, and the first name (given name), last. So for Jiang Zemin, Jiang is the family name, Zemin is the given name. For a Chinese businessperson or official who frequently interacts with foreigners, names may be spoken/written in the Western format. If you are uncertain as to which is which, it never hurts to ask for clarification.

Meet, Greet, or Address

Refer to a Chinese associate as Mr./Ms. (surname), or (title) and (surname). Using titles is a sign of respect and is done frequently in China. For example, it is preferable to address someone as Section Chief Zhang instead of Mr. Zhang. As in the United States, always address a person by the higher rank indicated in their title. For example, if you are meeting a vice governor or vice director, refer to them as Governor so and so or Director so and so, respectively, unless their superior (i.e. the governor or director) is present. Unless you are longtime friends, avoid calling Chinese by their first names. You may however call a Chinese you know well by his or her complete name. Chinese family names are usually listed first on their name cards and are almost always one syllable.

## Gifts Exchange

Guests are expected to give a gift to their Chinese host. It is helpful to bring an extra supply of wrapped gifts lest you be caught short-handed. A visiting group can give one large gift to the host organization or smaller mementos to individuals. Avoid gifts of excessive value or that are too personal. Try to find a gift that represents your home state, such as locally made products. As a fallback, many companies rely on gifts of nice crystal or company products such as pens or calendars that can be distributed to everyone.

Gifts are not usually opened in front of the person giving the gift, so do not think it is rude if your host tosses your gift aside. You also may receive gifts from your Chinese hosts. Again, as a rule, do not open the gift in their presence, although in some cases the Chinese may make a show of doing so for you. Gifts are usually exchanged at the end of a banquet or meeting.
