<p>On Chinese Banquets[‘bæŋkwɪt, 宴会], Timing is Everything. Guests should arrive on time. Punctuality[,pʌŋktjʊ’ælɪtɪ,严守时间] is a virtue[‘vɜːtjuː] in China. Banquets and business meetings are scheduled to start and finish on time, and the Western concept of “fashionably late” is not understood. If an event is scheduled to begin at 6:00 pm, for example, then arrive a few minutes early or at 6:00 pm sharp. To arrive later would be considered rude(无礼的). Just as they start on time, banquets also end on time. If a banquet is scheduled to end at 8:30 pm, the host should stand up and close the event at 8:30 pm sharp. It is considered rude to stay late or keep others at the banquet or meeting past the designated ending time.</p>

<h2 id="Banquets_Structure">Banquets Structure</h2>
<p>Chinese banquets typically last two hours. As guests arrive, they proceed through a receiving line in order of highest- to lowest-ranking hosts. Guests are then seated. Banquets in China have definitive beginnings and endings. The principal host offers a welcoming toast to begin the banquet (or shortly thereafter), and it is customary for the principal guest to reciprocate with his/her own toast. Upon toasting, the formal meal begins. At the conclusion of the banquet, the host will again stand and toast, thanking the guests for attending. Again, it is customary for the principal guest to reciprocate in thanks to the hosts.</p>
<p><strong>Banquets Seating</strong></p>
<p>Seating is typically arranged ahead of time through staff-to-staff contacts, according to rank. The principal guest is seated to the right of the principal host at the head table. Other guests are seated at other tables in a manner mirroring seating at the head table. Guests should notify the Chinese host in advance of the rank of visiting members of the delegation. If hosting an event, be sure to seat people of high rank with others of high rank, doing otherwise may be considered offensive.</p>
<h2 id="Banquets_Toasting">Banquets Toasting</h2>
<p>Toasting is an indispensable component of the Chinese banquet and it begins when the principal host offers a welcoming toast. Toasts are typically short (2 to 4 minutes) and may consist of a simple welcome, a brief statement filled with platitudes, or a substantive comment on the visit. Chinese rarely hold their glass at shoulder length when toasting, it is considered respectful to try and toast your glass lower than other’s glasses.</p>
<p>Alcohol Cautions:</p>
<p>Several types of liquor are traditionally served at Chinese banquets (beer, wine, and baijiu (a potent liquor, of which the most famous brand is Maotai). Glasses are kept full during the meal to allow for toasting. Beer and wine may be sipped, but baijiu is traditionally downed at once like a western “shot” in toasts with the Chinese guests. The Chinese toast “gan bei” literally means “dry glass.” However, the tradition of emptying one’s glass at each toast is being tempered in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai where Western business etiquette has been more widely accepted. Increasingly, wine (frequently mixed with soda) is becoming the primary toasting drink in major cities. If you find yourself in a situation where baijiu is served, it is acceptable to drink less than the whole glass by saying “ban bei” (half a shot) or “sui yi” (as you wish).</p>
<p>It is also possible to beg out of drinking alcohol entirely by saying that you have an allergy or simply explaining that you do not drink. It also is acceptable to toast with a clear carbonated drink like 7-Up or Sprite; just let the waiter know quietly that this is what you would like to do. If you are being hosted at a dinner (not a banquet) you often will be asked to choose what you would like to drink. Western drinks and social habits are becoming the norm in many ways, and are accepted in most urban areas, however, it is advisable to handle such situations by stating your preferences as food and drink are ordered.</p>
<h2 id="Using_Chopsticks_on_Banquets">Using Chopsticks on Banquets</h2>
<p>Chinese appreciate foreigners’ efforts to eat with chopsticks. If using chopsticks proves impossible and no forks are available, you can use the porcelain spoon.</p>
<p><strong>Banquets Eating</strong></p>
<p>Formal banquets often include a dozen or more dishes. While declining to taste a dish is not considered a cardinal offense, it is polite to try each dish that is served. This means it is important to pace yourself. Leaving a little on your plate signals your Chinese host that you are full. This is also a good strategy to avoid receiving another serving of a dish you do not like. An empty plate is a cue to your Chinese host that you are still hungry, and it will likely continue to be filled until you leave something on it. According to Chinese custom it is the role of the host to serve food to their guests, so do not be surprised if the host places food on your plate. If you are feeling very polite and have good chopstick control, you may reciprocate and attempt to serve the host, but it is not necessary. If you are hosting a dinner or banquet it is polite to make a gesture of serving guests on either side and then state clearly that everyone should please help himself/herself, adding “we are all friends and should be informal.”</p>
<h2 id="Last_Name_First">Last Name First</h2>
<p>In China, the family name (surname) appears first, and the first name (given name), last. So for Jiang Zemin, Jiang is the family name, Zemin is the given name. For a Chinese businessperson or official who frequently interacts with foreigners, names may be spoken/written in the Western format. If you are uncertain as to which is which, it never hurts to ask for clarification.</p>
<p>Meet, Greet, or Address</p>
<p>Refer to a Chinese associate as Mr./Ms. (surname), or (title) and (surname). Using titles is a sign of respect and is done frequently in China. For example, it is preferable to address someone as Section Chief Zhang instead of Mr. Zhang. As in the United States, always address a person by the higher rank indicated in their title. For example, if you are meeting a vice governor or vice director, refer to them as Governor so and so or Director so and so, respectively, unless their superior (i.e. the governor or director) is present. Unless you are longtime friends, avoid calling Chinese by their first names. You may however call a Chinese you know well by his or her complete name. Chinese family names are usually listed first on their name cards and are almost always one syllable.</p>
<h2 id="Gifts_Exchange">Gifts Exchange</h2>
<p>Guests are expected to give a gift to their Chinese host. It is helpful to bring an extra supply of wrapped gifts lest you be caught short-handed. A visiting group can give one large gift to the host organization or smaller mementos to individuals. Avoid gifts of excessive value or that are too personal. Try to find a gift that represents your home state, such as locally made products. As a fallback, many companies rely on gifts of nice crystal or company products such as pens or calendars that can be distributed to everyone.</p>
<p>Gifts are not usually opened in front of the person giving the gift, so do not think it is rude if your host tosses your gift aside. You also may receive gifts from your Chinese hosts. Again, as a rule, do not open the gift in their presence, although in some cases the Chinese may make a show of doing so for you. Gifts are usually exchanged at the end of a banquet or meeting.</p>
